## Description

The Password Strength Checker is a simple Python script that evaluates the strength of a given password based on various criteria such as the presence of lowercase and uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and whitespace. It provides feedback on the strength of the password and suggests improvements based on the observed characteristics.

## Usage

1. **Running the Script:**
   - Execute the Python script using a Python interpreter.
   - You will be prompted to enter a password.

2. **Password Evaluation:**
   - After entering the password, the script will analyze it and provide detailed information on its composition, including counts of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and whitespace.
   - It will then assess the overall strength of the password based on the observed criteria and provide a hint for improvement.

3. **Multiple Checks:**
   - You have the option to check multiple passwords in succession or to exit after each evaluation.
   - If you choose to check another password, you will be prompted to enter a new password.
